<em>About the Project</em>

➔ C++ Project based in a <strong>Catalog of animes</strong> that comes from a .csv file and will be stored in a Double Linked List with the Name, Number of Seasons, Number of Episodes, Release Year, Finish Date*, Main Genre and Status** with the possibility of:

  a) Show an Interval or Print the entire Catalog in alphabetic order of name or genre, latest releases order or without filters.

  b) Filter the Catalog by: Name, Number of Seasons, Number of Episodes, Release or Finish Year, Genre and Status.

  c) Write or Overwrite an anime with the option to save the changes in the list and file***.

  d) Remove an anime.

*If the anime are not finished yet, <em>Finish Year = 0</em>. 
**Status can be <em>“In Progress (Em Progresso)”</em> or <em>“Finished (Finalizado)”</em>. 
***The inserted data correspond the current state of the anime before the insert day on the catalog.

<strong>Functions</strong> 
➔ <em>Quick Sort</em>: Sort the catalog by Alphabetic order of <em>Name</em> or <em>Gender</em> and <em>Latest Releases</em>. Each one of the Quick sorts will have and assist partition to help the process of sorting. The datas from the list are transferred to an dynamic allocated vector to assist the process of sorting by the desired filter. Assist function of Quick Sort: “Troca”-> assist the partitions of the vector.

➔ <em>Menu</em>: A simple function that shows to the user the options that he owns to execute on the program, initially.

➔ <em>MensagemErro</em>: When the user digit an unavailable interval of options, this function will be called to show the error to the user and returns to the menu of the program.

➔ <em>Main</em>: Should capture the entries that the user digited and call another function to execute what the user wants.
